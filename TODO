Ensure correct functionality when the layer is changed while a key is held
Ensure that the keycode 0x0 isn't used for anything
Add debouncing algorithm
Make stuff const
Test debug error colouring
Make sure that characters in layer definitions are sent as keycodes properly
Ensure that initializing arrays with int array[128] = {0}; correctly initializes all indexes
Use PROGMEM for storing layers(Remember to update the docs too)
